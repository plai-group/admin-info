# Slack Workspace: (https://plai-group.slack.com)
Slack is the main means of communication for lab members.

While in most cases you can create your own channels, we recommend only doing so if a channel is actually going to be used long term.

External collaborators may be added to specific slack channels. Our experience is that external people are less likely to log into our slack workspace, so make sure to mention them explicitely in your messages to get a response. If their involvement is minimal, using a shared document with commenting ability might be a better choice.

# Github: (https://github.com/plai-group)

Any work done on PLAI Group project should be done on a repository belonging to the PLAI Group.

If you have an existing repository, you should transfer it to the PLAI group.

For most collaborations with multiple members of the group and external guests that involve code, we prefer to use the Github Team feature. This allows us to create a team, with a discussion forum, Kaban Board and pre-defined access previleges for repositories.  Any member of the team automatically received access to all repositories shared with a team, and automatically loses access when they leave the team.
