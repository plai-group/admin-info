# Slack
PLAI Group has a Slack workspace for team members to communicate. While in most cases you can create your own channels, we recommend only doing so if a channel is actually going to be used long term.

External collaborators may be added to specific slack channels. Our experience is that external people are less likely to log into our slack workspace, so make sure to mention them explicitely to get a response.

# Github
PLAI Group has an organizational Github. Any work done on PLAI Group project should be done on a repository belonging to the PLAI Group.
If you have an existing repository, you should transfer it to the PLAI group.
For most collaborations with multiple members of the group and external guests  that involve code, we prefer to use the Github Team feature. This allows us to create a team, with a discussion forum, Kaban Board and pre-defined access previleges for repositories.  Any member of the team automatically received access to all repositories shared with a team, and automatically loses access when they leave the team.
