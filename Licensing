# PLAI Group Sftware Licenses

Software released as part of research work needs to be compliant with UBC policies and contractual agreements which UBC might have.

Generally speaking, we use the Apache V2 license (which is available on Github). When setting up this license, you need to add the year the work was done and the license holder which should be "University of British Columbia".
