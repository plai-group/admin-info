# Accessing PLAI Workspace During COVID-19

Note: The information listed here is the plan for accessing the workspace as per UBC Return to Research Phase 3. 

Owing to the COVID-19 pandemic, access to the UBC Campus facilities including UBC CS was restricted. UBC is easing access now, and allowing the facilities to be used at higher capacity. Each room has a listed occupancy limit that needs to be met.

## Pre-requisits and Access Approval
Any lab member wishing to access the lab needs to:
* Review the [UBC Health and Safety COVID-19 page](https://srs.ubc.ca/covid-19/health-safety-covid-19)
* Review the [UBC COVID-19 Rules and Safety Plans](https://srs.ubc.ca/covid-19/safety-planning/covid-19-safety-training-rules/)
* Complete the new [UBC Go Forward COVID-19 Safety Planning Training](https://wpl.ubc.ca/browse/srs/courses/wpl-srs-gfsp)
* Submit an access request to plai-manager@cs.ubc.ca including:
  * Proof of completion of COVID-19 training (certificate)

## Accessing the Lab During the Pandemic
Rooms capacities are posted on the doors. 

* Follow the posted signage provided by the department, and remember to sanitize your hands upon entry to the building.
* We recommend wearing a mask when entewring the building.
* We recommend that you clean the workspace both before starting work, and after you are done using the wipes provided at the workstations. This includes:
  * The surface of the table
  * Seat handles
  * Any cables you used
  * Door knobs
  * Lights switches
  * Any other surface you touched 
* While in the lab, maintain social distancing and avoid touching surfaces other than the assigned workspace. We also recommend leaving windows open to improve airflow.
