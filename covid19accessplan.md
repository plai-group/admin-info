# Accessing PLAI Workspace During COVID-19

Note: The information listed here is the plan for accessing the workspace as per UBC Return to Research Phase 1. The plan has not yet been approved (on 31 July 2020).

Owing to the COVID-19 pandemic, access to the UBC Campus facilities including UBC CS was restricted. UBC is easing access now, and allowing the facilities to be used at 1/3 capacity.

## Pre-requisits and Access Approval
Any lab member wishing to access the lab needs to:
* Review the [UBC Health and Safety COVID-19 page](https://srs.ubc.ca/covid-19/health-safety-covid-19/?login)
* Complete the [UBC COVID-19 Training](https://srs.ubc.ca/covid-19/safety-planning/covid-19-safety-training-rules/)
* Submit an access request to plai-manager@cs.ubc.ca including:
  * Proof of completion of COVID-19 training (this can be a screenshot showing you have passed the quiz)
  * Reason for access to the lab (this can be as simple as being able to focus on work, etc)

We will get back to you on whether your access is approved or not.

## Accessing the Lab During the Pandemic
Each room within the lab (X-725, X-725A, and X-725B) is assigned a capacity of one person per room. We have created a rotating schedule, and access is restricted to 2 blocks of 4 hours per day, with a one hour buffer in between.

* Group members need to complete the [schedule](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1SL8aUzEALNrlZeRALzvchq2PJNKxyE47&authuser=ali.nasseri%40alumni.utoronto.ca&usp=drive_fs) by adding you initials on the day and time you wish to access the lab by Friday the week before access is needed.
* You should enter the building while wearing a mask/face covering. Masks cn be removed when you reach the relevant room assigned to you.
* Clean the workspace both before starting work, and after you are done using the wipes provided at the workstations.
* Make sure to leave before the end of the assigned time slot.
* While in the lab, maintain social distancing and avoid touching surfaces other than the assigned workspace.
