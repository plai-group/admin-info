# Accessing PLAI Workspace During COVID-19

Note: The information listed here is the plan for accessing the workspace as per UBC Return to Research Phase 1. The plan has not yet been approved (on 31 July 2020).

Owing to the COVID-19 pandemic, access to the UBC Campus facilities including UBC CS was restricted. UBC is easing access now, and allowing the facilities to be used at 1/3 capacity. Workspaces that are office-like are restricted to one individual per room.

## Pre-requisits and Access Approval
Any lab member wishing to access the lab needs to:
* Review the [UBC Health and Safety COVID-19 page](https://srs.ubc.ca/covid-19/health-safety-covid-19)
* Review the safety protocols (page 20 of [this document](https://my.cs.ubc.ca/system/files/docs/science_return_to_on-campus_research_documentation_approved_june_2.pdf))
* Complete the [UBC COVID-19 Training](https://srs.ubc.ca/covid-19/safety-planning/covid-19-safety-training-rules/)
* Submit an access request to plai-manager@cs.ubc.ca including:
  * Proof of completion of COVID-19 training (this can be a screenshot showing you have passed the quiz)
  * Reason for access to the lab (this can be as simple as being able to focus on work, etc)

We will get back to you on whether your access is approved or not.

## Accessing the Lab During the Pandemic
Each room within the lab (X-725, X-725A, and X-725B) is assigned a capacity of one person per room. We have created a rotating schedule, and access is restricted to 2 blocks of 4 hours per day, with a one hour buffer in between.

* Group members need to complete the [schedule](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1SL8aUzEALNrlZeRALzvchq2PJNKxyE47&authuser=ali.nasseri%40alumni.utoronto.ca&usp=drive_fs) by adding you initials on the day and time you wish to access the lab by Friday the week before access is needed. Preference is for you to access the same room, so that we can give you a dedicated desk.
* You should enter the building while wearing a mask/face covering. Masks can be removed when you reach the relevant room assigned to you.
* When you get to campus and enter the room, you should send a check-in message on slack to Ali Nasseri.
* Clean the workspace both before starting work, and after you are done using the wipes provided at the workstations. This includes:
  * The surface of the table
  * Seat handles
  * Any cables you used
  * Door knobs
  * Lights switched
  * Any other surface you touched 
* Make sure to leave before the end of the assigned time slot.
* When ending your shift in the lab, send a check-out message on slack to Ali Nasseri.
* While in the lab, maintain social distancing and avoid touching surfaces other than the assigned workspace.
