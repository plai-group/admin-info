## Onboarding
For new members, here's a brief summary of how to set up. If you're currently going through the onboarding process and find any of the information below out of date or incomplete, please fix it to spare the next person the trouble you're going through.

### HR processing
Every new group member needs to go through the relevant HR process at UBC. The procedure depends on your appointment type and is usually initiated by the relevant staff. Below is a checklist of the essentials that you should obtain by the end of this process.
- [ ] Campus-Wide Login (CWL)
- [ ] UBC card or a visitors pass granting you access to the building and the relevant offices, in particular X725
- [ ] an allocated desk in the department
- [ ] if you are getting paid from UBC, you should submit the relevant documentation to payroll

Contact Kath in the first instance if you're missing any of the above.

### Department computing facilities
The access to departmental computing facilities is granted after the relevant form is submitted to the IT helpdesk, which is usually initiated by Kath but can be done by the user if they can obtain Frank's signature. Once the form is processed, you will receive an email form IT with instructions for how to set up the account. You'll then get access to various departmental facilities described on [this website](https://my.cs.ubc.ca). You should make sure you have the following:
- [ ] email account in `@cs.ubc.ca` where you can send and receive email
- [ ] `ssh` access to departmental computers through `remote.cs.ubc.ca`
- [ ] membership in `fwood` group on departmental computers, which you can verify by running the `groups` command
- [ ] ability to connect to the departmental VPN
- [ ] your personal devices connected to `ubcsecure` and `eduroam` wifi networks
- [ ] ability to print to the departmental printers

If you're unable to get one or more of the above, ask your fellow lab members for help.

### PLAI internet resources
We have a bunch of internet resources that are not managed by the department. You should obtain access to the following:
- [ ] `plai-list` mailing list (contact Rob if you're not getting these emails)
- [ ] Google calendar for Frank's schedule (not sure whom to contact)
- [ ] Slack workspace `plai-group` (not sure whom to contact)
- [ ] GitHub organization `plai-group` (contact Christian if you haven't received an invitation)

### Computing resources
Our main computing resources are the local computing cluster and Compute Canada. You should make sure you have access to and learn to run jobs on both of them. More information [here](https://github.com/michaeljteng/cluster-docs/wiki).
