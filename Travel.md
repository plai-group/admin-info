# PLAI group travel info

The lab can currently support travel of lab members. Our policy is as follows:
* The lead author of a conference presentation or poster will automatically be supported through lab funds.
* Second authors of a conference presentation or poster can apply for the UBC Graduate Student travel Fund (https://www.grad.ubc.ca/awards/graduate-student-travel-fund). The PLAI group will match the funding received.
* Other author of a conference presentation or poster are generally ot supported.
* Each student is entitled to a single funded summer school
* If you do receive partial funding from other sources for your conference (such as programs the conference run), we can discuss a contribution from the lab on top of that as well.
