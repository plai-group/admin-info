# PLAI Travel Policy
PLAI Group supports travel of lab members to conferences and other meetings to present their work:
* The lead author of a conference presentation or poster will automatically be supported through lab funds. Additional authors may also be supported, ask Frank for confirmation.
* All authors should apply for the [UBC Graduate Student travel Fund](https://www.grad.ubc.ca/awards/graduate-student-travel-fund), [PDF Travel Awards](https://www.postdocs.ubc.ca/award/pdf-travel-awards) or other similar programs to help offset costs.

## Travel Booking and Reimbursement
* We encourage you to book your travel yourself. Please be sure to have your itinerary approved prior to booking.
* For large conferences, and group travel, we will coordinate a short-term rental for the group.

## Before your trip:
* Make sure to familarize yourself with the [UBC Finance travel policy](https://finance.ubc.ca/procure-pay/expenditure-guidelines/travel-expenditures)
* Your trip is finalized when you get approval for spending. Do not book your trip beforehand.
