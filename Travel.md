# PLAI group travel info

The lab can currently support travel of lab members. In this document, we summarize the lab policy on Travel and procedures you need to follow if you are traveling.

# PLAI Travel Policy
Our current policy is as follows:
* The lead author of a conference presentation or poster will automatically be supported through lab funds.
* Second authors of a conference presentation or poster can apply for the UBC Graduate Student travel Fund (https://www.grad.ubc.ca/awards/graduate-student-travel-fund). The PLAI group will match the funding received.
* Other author of a conference presentation or poster are generally ot supported.
* Each student is entitled to a single funded summer school
* If you do receive partial funding from other sources for your conference (such as programs the conference run), we can discuss a contribution from the lab on top of that as well.

# Procdures for Travel Booking and Reimbursement
You can completely book your travel yourself, or we can book your flight and accomodation for you using the PLAI Group credit card (to reduce the financial strain on you prior to the trip).

* Make sure to familarize yourself with UBC Finance travel policy: https://finance.ubc.ca/procure-pay/expenditure-guidelines/travel-expenditures

  * Your travel itinerary (could be the link from google flight)

  * Whether you want us to prebook thr trip for you. If you do want us to book it, you can either share your Full legal name with us, or visit us in the office so we make sure your personal details are entered correctly.
* Your trip is finalized when you get approval from the lab manager that the spending is fine. Do not book your trip beforehand.
* If you ask us to book the trip, you will receive confirmation in your CS email.

Make sure to keep all the receipts your want to be reimbursed for during the trip, and get invoices when possible. Note thet university per diem policy here: https://finance.ubc.ca/travel/reconcile/meals-diem

After your trip:
* Fill the travel UBC CS reimbursement form: https://my.cs.ubc.ca/system/files/docs/Students%20and%20Postdocs%20Travel%20Reimbursement%20Claim%20Form.pdf

However, missing receipt forms will not be accepted in cases where a receipt can reasonably be retrieved (original or copy).
