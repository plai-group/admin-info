# PLAI group travel info

PLAI Group currently supports travel of lab members to conferences and other meetings to present their work. In this document, we summarize the lab policy on Travel and procedures you need to follow if you are traveling.

# PLAI Travel Policy
Our current policy is as follows:
* The lead author of a conference presentation or poster will automatically be supported through lab funds.
* Second authors of a conference presentation or poster can apply for the [UBC Graduate Student travel Fund](https://www.grad.ubc.ca/awards/graduate-student-travel-fund), [PDF Travel Awards](https://www.postdocs.ubc.ca/award/pdf-travel-awards) or other similar programs. The PLAI group will match the funding received.
* Other authors of a conference presentation or poster are generally not supported.
* If you do receive partial funding from other sources for your conference (such as programs the conference runs), we can discuss a contribution from the lab on top of that as well.

# Procedures for Travel Booking and Reimbursement
You can book your travel yourself, or we can book your flight and accomodation for you using the PLAI Group credit card. In both cases, your travel itinerary needs to be approved by the lab prior to booking; otherwise, the lab will not be responsible for the costs.

## Before your trip:
* Make sure to familarize yourself with the [UBC Finance travel policy](https://finance.ubc.ca/procure-pay/expenditure-guidelines/travel-expenditures)
* Your trip is finalized when you get approval from the lab manager that the spending is fine. Do not book your trip beforehand.

## During your trip:
Make sure to keep all the receipts you want to be reimbursed for during the trip, and get invoices when possible. This specially includes:
* Invoice from hotel/accomodation provider
* Boarding passes and other transportation tickets
* Receipts/invoices for food purchases
* Certificate of attendance to the conference

Note the [university per diem policy](https://finance.ubc.ca/travel/reconcile/meals-diem) which might affect reimbursement of food and other items.

## After your trip:
*  Submit an [expense request in Workday](https://irp.ubc.ca/sites/integrated-renewal.ubc.ca/files/images/How%20Do%20I%20-%20Get%20Reimbursed%20for%20Expenses.pdf)
  * The Grant determines which account your costs are charged to. Check with the lab manager before filling the form to determing which speedchart to use.
  * We recomend following [this knowledgebase article](https://ubc.service-now.com/selfservice?id=kb_article&sys_id=345630b747a41294efc6767b416d4316&table=kb_knowledge) for details on submitting an expense report.
* You do not need to include any items that was pre-booked by PLAI lab using the the PLAI credit card in your reimbursement request. 
* Keep relevant documents (receipts, invoices) for 3 months or until reibursement is made, whichever is longer.
