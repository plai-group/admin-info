# PLAI group travel info

The lab can currently support travel of lab members. In this document, we summarize the lab policy on Travel and procedures you need to follow if you are traveling.

# PLAI Travel Policy
Our current policy is as follows:
* The lead author of a conference presentation or poster will automatically be supported through lab funds.
* Second authors of a conference presentation or poster can apply for the [UBC Graduate Student travel Fund](https://www.grad.ubc.ca/awards/graduate-student-travel-fund) or other similar programs. The PLAI group will match the funding received.
* Other authors of a conference presentation or poster are generally not supported.
* Each student is entitled to a single funded summer school
* If you do receive partial funding from other sources for your conference (such as programs the conference run), we can discuss a contribution from the lab on top of that as well.

# Procedures for Travel Booking and Reimbursement
You can completely book your travel yourself, or we can book your flight and accomodation for you using the PLAI Group credit card (to reduce the financial strain on you prior to the trip).

## Before your trip:
* Make sure to familarize yourself with [UBC Finance travel policy](https://finance.ubc.ca/procure-pay/expenditure-guidelines/travel-expenditures)
* Fill the [Travel Request Form](https://cs-plai-2019.sites.olt.ubc.ca/internal/travel-request/). You will need the following information:
  * The conference name, dates, link
  * Short description for the reason of your trip (usually this will be something like "I am doing a talk/poster on XYZ")
  * Your travel itinerary/flight information (could be the link from google flight)
  * Your accomodation info (could be a link)
  * Total cost
  * If you want us to book the itinerary for you, please mention that in your message. We will need your full legal name and date of birth.
* Your trip is finalized when you get approval from the lab manager that the spending is fine. Do not book your trip beforehand.
* If you ask us to book the trip for you, you will receive confirmation that your trip is fine and the booking confirmation in your CS email.

## During your trip:

Make sure to keep all the receipts your want to be reimbursed for during the trip, and get invoices when possible. This specially includes:
* Invoice from hotel/accomodation provider
* Boarding passes and other tickets
* Certificate of attendance to the conference

Note the [university per diem policy](https://finance.ubc.ca/travel/reconcile/meals-diem) which might affect reimbursement of food and other items.

## After your trip:
* Fill the [UBC CS travel reimbursement form](https://my.cs.ubc.ca/system/files/docs/Students%20and%20Postdocs%20Travel%20Reimbursement%20Claim%20Form.pdf)
  * The speedchart number determines which account your costs are charged to. Check with the lab manager before filling the form to determing which speedchart to use.
* If you do not have your original itemized receipt, a [missing receipt form](https://my.cs.ubc.ca/system/files/docs/Missing_Receipt%20Form.docx) should be used. However, missing receipt forms will not be accepted in cases where a receipt can reasonably be retrieved (original or copy).
* You do not need to include any items that was pre-booked by PLAI lab using the credit card in your reimbursement request. Do keep the relevant documents though for 3 months in case we need them later on.
* Submit the form to finance@cs.ubc.ca along with a copy of your receipts, or drop it off with Annie or Brenda in the finance department.
