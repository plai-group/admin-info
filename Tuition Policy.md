# PLAI Tuition Policy

## Support

PhD-level research students in CS can expect to have their costs (mostly) covered by UBC ([FoS Tuition Fee Awards](https://www.cs.ubc.ca/students/grad/awards/tuition-fee-scholarships)). MSc-level students should receive a level of institutional support as well.  

We ensure that all PLAI graduate students do not bear the cost of remaining tuition or fees by **increasing stipends by the outstanding amount**. This is applied on an individual basis.

## Procedure

1. **Accept all available awards.**  
2. **Submit the [Tuition Reimbursement Form](#)**  
3. **Ensure you pay your tuition and fees on time** to avoid late fees ([Payment Due Dates](https://vancouver.calendar.ubc.ca/fees/policies-fees#15539-pay-and-due))  

> **Note:** This policy supplements UBC scholarships and awards. All members are encouraged, and will be supported, to apply for available awards ([Graduate Award Opportunities](https://www.grad.ubc.ca/scholarships-awards-funding/award-opportunities)).
